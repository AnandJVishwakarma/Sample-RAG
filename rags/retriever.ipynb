As \\nmost of us will know, yoga is a culture of physical, mental and spiritual discipline perfected in ancient India. Yoga as an ancient Indian discipline is a composite practice, involving the complete mind-body-soul complex that is a human being. Here, let us focus on yoga as an integrated system of physical exercises that help us to attain concentration, focus and also improve flexibility, balance, and strength.\\nFrom an ancient Indian discipline, let us move \\nto a very contemporary area of research. Experts today are doing a wonderful job of drawing us into the world of biomimicry. In simple terms, bio means life and mimicry is to emulate. Basically biomimicry is the science of solving human problems with solutions already present in the natural world. From this point of view, yoga is also a form of biomimicry where in typical asanas or poses, we emulate mountains, trees, fish, cats, and so many more animals! This helps solve our problems brought on by day to day living – such as stiffness and back pain – and allows us to feel physically vibrant and mentally sharp.\\nBefore we proceed further, here are a few basic \\nprecautions regarding yoga practice:\\n1. If you are a beginner, you should start\\npractising yoga either in the presence of a yoga teacher or join yoga class so that you learn the basics and the do’s and don’ts of yoga.\\n2. Asanas should be practised in a clean, airy\\nand well-lit room. The floor should be level. It is advisable to use a yoga mat. If it is not possible to practise indoors, you may practise on level ground outdoors.\\n3.

But few know his inspirational life story, which is all about courage and fighting against the odds.\\nMichael Faraday was born into a poverty-\\nstricken family in a dirty London suburb. He suffered from a speech defect as a child. He would pronounce ‘rabbit’ as ‘wabbit’. He could not even say his own name and would call himself ‘Fawaday’. Other children laughed at him and teachers did not help him either. When he was twelve, his mother was forced to take him out of school, thus putting an end to his formal education.\\nAt thirteen, however, he started working with a \\nbookbinder, binding hundreds of book during the day and staying up all night to read them. Reading thus became his obsession. One day he came across a book on electricity which had been sent to his master for binding. He started reading it and was completely hooked. That was his first introduction to the subject of electricity, which soon became a lifelong fascination.\\nFaraday was still poor at twenty-one. Once, a \\nfriend gave him a free ticket to a public lecture and demonstration by the renowned chemist Humphry Davy at London’s Royal Institution. Davy’s work on chemicals and electrical lighting was the subject of conversation among the scientists  \\nThink and answer :\\nzWhy do you think\\nFaraday’s friendgive him a freeticket to Davy’sprogramme?zBefore you read\\nfurther, guess whatthe passage isabout.\\n\\t Listen, read \\nand answer :\\nzWhat were the\\nodds against Faraday \\nin his childhood ?\\nWhat is meaning of :\\n•Reading became\\nhis obsession\\n•Electricity became\\na lifelong fascination.Great scientists are persevering and \\nnever deterred by difficulties.\\n', metadata={'source': 'std7-bb-english.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",

Seventy years later, across the Atlantic \\nOcean in the USA, the same work enabled Thomas Edison to produce the first consistent light bulb.\\nThat day in 1812 Faraday was spellbound by \\nDavy’s lecture. He kept taking notes about the ‘mysterious force of electric fluid’. He was so engrossed in the lecture that he forgot to applaud with the rest of the crowd. When he went back, his notes were so comprehensive that he bound them into a book, meaning to gift it to Davy some day. Faraday decided that day that he didn’t just want to sell books, he wanted to be a great scientist \\n-good enough to write his own books. Davy\\nbecame his role model. But there was a problem.He did not have the social status, money or theeducation to pursue science. Faraday thought itwould be wonderful if Davy became his mentor,but Davy did not agree initially. Faraday was notdejected; he just kept trying.\\nDestiny had a strange plan in store for him. A \\nfew years later, a chemical explosion happened inside Davy’s lab and he was temporarily blinded. He now needed an assistant with an excellent memory to help him. He was reminded of Faraday and decided to hire him as his secretary. Davy never believed Faraday could do anything in the field of science going by his social status and education. He therefore dismissed Faraday’s aspirations and advised him to stick to bookbinding. But Faraday was relentless. He worked day and night and learnt as much as he could about Davy’s experiments. Soon Faraday became indispensable to Davy, and was promoted to his lab assistant. This was his first step towards a scientific career. Though much of his job now was cleaning labs, at least he got to see some of Davy’s leading experiments.\\nEven then Davy did not have much hope for \\nFaraday.

This piece of glass became a significant thing in his life.\\nFaraday had a never - give - up attitude and he \\nrespected Davy. So he accepted the assignment, despite knowing that it would be very difficult. He toiled for four years, with no help from Davy, and, as expected, failed. Faraday never learned the secret, and this remained his first failure as a scientist. To remind himself of these difficult times, he kept a single glass brick on his shelf as a souvenir.

He was free to pursue whatever he liked, and he made another revolutionary discovery. He noticed that if he moved a magnet, it could produce electrical current; thus he could now convert motion into electricity.

Then, they would be able to enter the bank and steal the gold without breaking open the doors of the bank. Using the tunnel, they entered the cellar. They planned to steal the gold, and go back to Mr Wilson’s house, again through the tunnel, and then get away.\\n“But how could you guess what their motive \\nwas?”\\n“When I heard that the assistant worked \\nfor half the wages, I became suspicious. Using Mr Wilson’s description of his assistant, I made enquiries. I found that he was the criminal Clay. \\nWhy was he working in Mr Wilson’s shop ?

When we visited the shop, I beat upon the pavement with my stick to find out whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. I saw the bank on the other side of the house and guessed what the criminals had in mind. When Clay answered the bell, the knees of his trousers were wrinkled and stained! It confirmed my suspicion that he was digging.
